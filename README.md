## Game Overview
In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. 
The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar.

## How it works
When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen.
The player shoots and destroys the aliens. 

## The rules 
- If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. 
- If any alien hits the playerâ€™s ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. 
- If the player loses three ships, the game ends.
